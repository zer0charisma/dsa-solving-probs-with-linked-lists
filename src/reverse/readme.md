# Reverse a list

Write an algorithm to reverse a linked list. That is, given a linked list such as:

![A linked list](reverse_001.png)

your algorithm should return the linked list:

![Reversed linked list](reverse_002.png)

The time complexity of your algorithm should be linear (O(n)).

Attempt to solve this problem using both recursive and iterative algorithms.
